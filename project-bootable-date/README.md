# PalisadeOS Finished Phase

Reminder: Only because the OS is finished and bootable, it doesn't mean it'll stop updating, instead, it'll continue updating and changing.

Prediction creation date: Jan 15 2026

## Prediction

palisade os is in a fast pre-stabilization phase with daily date-style builds.

the core structure needed for booting already exists and is converging.

remaining work is mostly boot correctness and early kernel cleanup.

no large architectural resets appear necessary at this stage.

daily iteration strongly accelerates fault discovery and fixes.

"ready to boot" only requires deterministic startup, not full features.

based on current cadence, progress is consistent and predictable.

the most likely boot-ready window is early february 2026.

february 9, 2026 is the strongest single-day estimate.

this milestone marks technical viability, not project completion.
